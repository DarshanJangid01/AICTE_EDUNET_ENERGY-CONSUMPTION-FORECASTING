Household Energy Consumption Forecasting

Project Overview:
This repository contains a time-series forecasting project that predicts household electricity consumption using historical data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The project focuses on analyzing and modeling energy usage patterns to enable better energy management, planning, and sustainability.

Key Features:

Preprocessing and cleaning of high-frequency household electricity consumption data
Handling missing values and resampling data for forecasting
Exploratory data analysis including trends, seasonality, and correlations
Forecasting using statistical models (ARIMA, Prophet)
Visualization of historical consumption and predicted values

Dataset:

Individual Household Electric Power Consumption
Measurements include Global Active Power, Global Reactive Power, Voltage, and Sub-metering 1â€“3

Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Time-Series Models (ARIMA, Prophet)
Jupyter Notebook

Goal:
To provide accurate predictions of household energy consumption and uncover patterns that can help optimize energy usage for sustainability and efficiency.
